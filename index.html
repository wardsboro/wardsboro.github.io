                    <p>(as appears in the July 2018 edition of the Bucketville News)</p>
                    <p>By 4th of July Committee</p>
                    <img class="pull-left" src="files/postcard.JPG">
<p>Downtown Wardsboro doesn’t look the same as this 1907 postcard but it still has that old fashioned feel with the 69th Annual 4th of July Parade and Street Fair still happening here since 1949.  Make your plans to come to Wardsboro on the 4th and enjoy all that there is to offer at the best and longest running Independence Day celebration ever.</p>
<p>The street fair opens at 9 am.  Over 40 local and creative vendors will line Main Street with their wares ranging from everything imaginable to the unimaginable! – Soaps, Hand knits, Pottery, Jewelry, Wood Carvings, Clocks just to name a few.</p> 
<p>Get there early for the luscious homemade strawberry shortcake, which will be served from the church vestry or for hamburgers, hotdogs, fries which will be hot off the grill right outside Town Hall.  Pop inside Town Hall to purchase pies of every filling all made by local pie makers. The bake sale will be brimming with goodies also homemade by locals. Coffee and donuts will be served and sold from the rolling cart up and down Main Street.  The White Elephant Sale will be situated on in front of the garage next to the library and will offer many choice items.</p>
<p>The parade will begin as usual at 10 am after the church bell rings and our national anthem is sung. Amazing original and ingenious floats, walkers, and vintage cars plus fire trucks from Wardsboro and other local towns will pass by the reviewing stands and turn around to receive their awards from the judges.</p> 
<p>Cool off with some ice cream, which can be found near the children’s Games.  The Boy Scouts are running the Children’s games as a fundraiser - so be sure to support them!</p>
<p>Barbequed chicken with all the fixins’ will be served at 11 AM near Town Hall.   Don’t miss the display of new and vintage quilts and which can be found in the Methodist Church.</p>
 
<p>The Library Trustees annual book sale takes place all day on the library lawn.  Their Duck Race in the West River will begin at 2PM.</p>
 
<p>The History House will be focusing on the history of the Wardsboro Volunteer Fire Department, which started in 1936.</p>
 
<p>Marvin Bentley, Ida Mae Specker and Jimmy Knapp’s Green Mountain Ridge Runners will provide music throughout the day.</p>
 
<p>The Friends of the Wardsboro Library will be selling art and collectibles as well as raffle tickets for their “Best Ever Raffle” of a beautiful Handcrafted Rock Maple Side Table.</p>
 
<p>Speaking of raffles, don’t miss this one! There will be 4 drawings of a one-day $100 Adult Lift Ticket at Mount Snow for the 2018/2019 season. Four chances to win $5 each or $20 for 5. Print your tickets in advance by visiting the 4thofJulyWardsboro.com.</p>

<p>Volunteers for set-up, clean-up, parking, cashiers, baking, prepping strawberries, trash pick-up, pie making, and servers are always needed to help out before during and after this great day!  Please say yes if you are called upon even if it is only for an hour of your time. Feel free to call Lee Miller, Volunteer chair (896-6080) to offer help.

                    <p class="text-left">The parade starts by the bridge, proceeds south on Rte. 100 and then turns by the Wardsboro Country Store and heads down Main Street before turning around and following the same route in reverse. The Street Fair is along Main Street on both sides. Listen for the ringing of the Church Bell that signals the start of the parade at 10 a.m. Ribbons for the parade floats and participants are awarded on the return trip so stay to see who this year's winners will be.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p class="text-left">The Street Fair & Parade evolved from a need to raise funds for the Yoked Parish. A few farsighted souls came up with the idea of a simple street fair with a novelty booth, handicraft booth, games for kids, homemade sandwiches, pie slices, and a little parade with a few floats and kids on bikes. The community began to be involved more and more because it was so much fun. The Wardsboro Yoked Parish runs the parade and most of the proceeds go to help community members in need. </p>
