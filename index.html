                    <p>By the 4th of July Committee</p>
                    <img class="pull-left pad-right" src="img/flag_bvn.png">
                    <p>The snow has melted and the warm summer days are ahead. Happily, the 70th annual Wardsboro 4th of July Street Fair and parade is just around the corner, this being our 70th year and the longest consecutive running 4th of July celebration in Vermont.</p>
                    <p>We are planning many surprises as well as the usual exciting events of years past. New this year will be a “Made in Wardsboro” room where you will find items by local artists and craftspeople displayed; it will be in the small meeting room on the 1st floor on the left as you enter Town Hall. Wander through the room and marvel at the hidden talents of Wardsboro residents.</p>
                    <p>See more detail of this event in the informational box elsewhere in this issue. Who says there’s no such thing as a free lunch? Enter the first ever Wardsboro 4th of July Hot Dog Eating contest and you can enjoy six hotdogs for your free lunch! The first to finish all six gets ‘bragging rights’ and a trophy! Ready to sign up? Call Lise or Russ at 896-6188.</p>
                    <p>At 9am the Street Fair Vendors will be showing off every type of handmade arts and craft as well as lemonade, baked bread and ice cream. You can count on our delicious offering of fresh Strawberry Shortcake in the vestry, homemade pies and scrumptious baked items inside Town Hall. Sneak over to the hamburg and hot dog booth outside to the right of Town Hall.</p>
                    <p>White Elephant tables can be found next to MacMichael Park. “One man’s trash is another man's treasure” is illustrated each year at this booth, which is not to be missed. At 10am the parade will be going down Main Street to dazzle you. All is on schedule with unique floats now in the “working” stage but soon to be ready for display and judging for awards.</p>
                    <p>Wouldn’t you like to join the parade? You can march in costume or not, drive your vintage car, create a float, ride a horse, show off your prize cow or emu, or your pet dog, cat, canary or donkey. To join the parade simply arrive by 9am at the bridge on South Wardsboro Road where there will be someone to greet you and guide you to your place in the parade.</p>
                    <p>Parking, at $4 per car, will be available in fields on roads entering the town center: on Rte. 100 entering from the north or south, upper Main Street from Jamaica, and on the South Wardsboro Road. Additionally there are four Handicap Accessible spaces provided by the Wardsboro General Store. A shuttle bus is available from some locations.</p>
                    <p>No amount of “thanks” is enough for the volunteers who continue to offer their time for this event, yet still more is needed. Think about being involved in this great celebration. An hour or two would be great, on the evening before to assist setting up tables, chairs, trash bins etc., or on the day of during or after the event to do what ever is needed to “breaking down”. Contact Chairperson Katryna Fitzpatrick at (802)896-1047 to volunteer; she will find an area where you can help.</p>
                    <p>Mark your calendar for Thursday July 4th : Street Fair starts at 9am, Parade at 10am and the BBQ service at 11am. Rain or shine, we will celebrate the 4th of July in Wardsboro.</p>

                    <p>Items for the 4th of July White Elephant sale (which in good repair) can be dropped off on Wednesday evenings June 12th, June 19th, June 26th from 6 to 8:30pm at the Town Garage next to the driveway entrance to the Wardsboro Public Library.</p>
                    <h3>Donations Requested For Library Trustees Annual 4th of July Book Sale</h3>
                    <p>Do you have books you would like to donate? This is a great way to recycle books to make room for new.</p>
                    <p>The Wardsboro Public Library trustees and volunteers run their annual 4th of July book sale fundraiser on the front lawn of the Library. Proceeds from the sale go toward library expenses not covered by the Town budget, such as the free children and adult programs, books and supplies.</p>
                    <p>Please bring your book donations to the library, at 170 Main Street. Wardsboro during regular hours or call Jill to arrange alternate drop off time 802 896-6988.</p>
                    <h3 class="section-heading">Attention All Wardsboro Artisans!</h3>
                    <p>The 4th of July Committee would like to celebrate the talent in our community during the 70th annual 4th of July Street Fair and Parade. We know Wardsboro is home to artists, crafters, writers, cooks, gardeners and many other creative people. Some do sell or display their creations for others to see while others quietly enjoy their creations on a personal level and share with a close few.</p>
                    <p>We want to show how proud we are of all of you all. We are asking all interested Wardsboro residents to display a sample of their unique creations in Town Hall during our July 4th celebration.</p>
                    <p>Darlene Rutnik is compiling an email and/or telephone list so she can reach as many artisans as possible and to explain the details of this event. To join the display of creative talent, call Darlene at 896-6394 or email her at upperpodunk@myfairpoint.net .</p>

                    <p class="text-left">The parade starts by the bridge, proceeds south on Rte. 100 and then turns by the Wardsboro Country Store and heads down Main Street before turning around and following the same route in reverse. The Street Fair is along Main Street on both sides. Listen for the ringing of the Church Bell that signals the start of the parade at 10 a.m. Ribbons for the parade floats and participants are awarded on the return trip so stay to see who this year's winners will be.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <p class="text-left">The Street Fair & Parade evolved from a need to raise funds for the Yoked Parish. A few farsighted souls came up with the idea of a simple street fair with a novelty booth, handicraft booth, games for kids, homemade sandwiches, pie slices, and a little parade with a few floats and kids on bikes. The community began to be involved more and more because it was so much fun. The Wardsboro Yoked Parish runs the parade and most of the proceeds go to help community members in need. </p>
